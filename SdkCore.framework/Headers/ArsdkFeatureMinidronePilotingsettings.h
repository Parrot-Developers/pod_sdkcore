 This setting represents the vertical acceleration command that will be sent to the drone when piloting in gaz mode.
In this case, closed loop height control is no longer performed; an open loop vertical acceleration command is generated instead.
This command results from multiplying the user command coming from the joystick (float value between 0 and 1) by the MaxThrottle setting (also a value between 0 and 1) and by the gravity constant.
Thus, we obtain the corresponding value in [m/s^2] that will then be mixed with the attitude commands and translated into rotation speeds.
As an example, if the value of this setting is 0.5, the maximal acceleration command that can be generated when the user command equals 1 is :
acc_cmd_max = 1 * 0.5 * 9.81 m/s^2 = 4.905 m/s^2.
